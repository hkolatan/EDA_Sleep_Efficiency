# EDA Sleep Efficiency Dataset
 
This repository, is my first EDA project for [Mervan Özekinci's](https://github.com/MervanOzekinci) Mini Bootcamp.

In this project, I analyzed the sleep efficiency dataset. By analyzing the factors affecting sleep duration and sleep efficiency, I tried to make inferences based on gender and age. 

Since this is my first EDA project, there may be many errors and omissions in the methodology. Please do not pay attention to these.

English version will be added later.
